/// (<c>Song.TagModel</c>) is weaker than the current strong model - and the funnel's cache-acceptance
/// decision - a cached AI response is reusable only when the model that produced it is at least as strong
/// as the model the current request would run.
///
/// Fail-safe by construction: an unknown or null model resolves to strength 0, and staleness is a strict
/// less-than against the CURRENT strong model's strength - so if the current model was never registered
/// (strength 0), nothing is ever stale. Forgetting to register a newly-adopted model therefore results in a
/// no-op (callers should log a warning via <see cref="Knows"/>), never a surprise whole-library re-tag.
/// Songs with a null TagModel (the pre-provenance library, or self-tagged rows that predate stamping) have
/// strength 0 and are stale whenever a registered strong model is in play - which is exactly the upgrade
/// scenario the registry exists for.
